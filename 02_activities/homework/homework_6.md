### Reflection on Ethics and Inequity in Database Management

As a Database Administrator, my daily work involved accessing the backend of our databases to maintain data integrity and performance. While I considered using SQL to streamline operations, I chose not to due to concerns about data privacy and security.

Protecting sensitive information, such as personal identifiers and financial records, was my top priority. I realized that mishandling this data could have serious consequences for both the company and individuals. This experience made me more aware of the need to integrate ethical considerations into our data practices.

Looking back, I see the importance of creating a framework that addresses ethics and inequity in data management. In the future, I would promote training on ethical data use and the significance of equitable access to information. By fostering a culture of ethical awareness, we can ensure that data is handled responsibly and fairly for everyone involved.
